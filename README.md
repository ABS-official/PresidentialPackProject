        1: Open the folder "My Documents\Baldur's Gate - Enhanced Edition\portraits". If there isn't already a folder named
            "portraits", just make one
            
        2: Simply drop all of the .bmp portrait files into this folder and they are ready to use.
        
        3: Open the game directory folder; For Steam installations this should be

        3: From each presidents' folder in the unzipped file, simply drop the .wav files to the sounds directory. Good to go.
