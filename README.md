# PresidentialPackProject

    ## Introduction:
    
        This is a project I work on in my spare time and is licensed under CC. Use it however you want.
    
        A project for Infinity engine games from the 1990's (Specifically Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition,
        though it can work with BG2EE and IWDEE as well) to add custom portraits and soundpacks for US presidents. 
        This project is not a reflection of political stance. Plans are to continue to add portraits and soundpacks
        for US presidents going backward in time.

        All presidents will be demonized into the Tiefling race, regardless of their political stance. The sound packs
        are English only and use actual audio clips from the actual presidents themselves from around the internet,
        mashed up to create something that reflects their personality and not their political stance.

        In this way, to remain canonical to Faerun and the Dungeons and Dragons theme and universe, I've made a deliberate
        effort to refrain from using audio clips containing words like "America" or "We the People" etc. The goal is
        to establish a sense of characterter transcendence from real-world US leaders into the Forgotten Realms lore.
        
    ##INSTALLATION:
    
        1: Open the folder "My Documents\Baldur's Gate - Enhanced Edition\portraits". If there isn't already a folder named
            "portraits", just make one
            
        2: Simply drop all of the .bmp portrait files into this folder and they are ready to use.
        
        3: Open the game directory folder; For Steam installations this should be
            "[root folder]\steamapps\common\Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition\lang\en_US\sounds"
            
        3: From each presidents' folder in the unzipped file, simply drop the .wav files to the sounds directory. Good to go.
